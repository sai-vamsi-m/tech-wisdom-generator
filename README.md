# Tech Quote Generator

This project is a simple quote generator that displays a random quote each time the "New Quote" button is clicked. The quotes are fetched from a Quote Generator API and displayed on the webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By clicking on Tweet button, we can tweet the generated quote on twitter.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

This project was created using the following tools:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Quotable API


## ‚ùáÔ∏è Getting Started

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser, you should see a webpage with a "New Quote" and "Tweet" buttons. Clicking those buttons will display a new random quote on the page and can tweet the quote on twitter 

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The project uses JavaScript to fetch a random quote from the Quotable API each time the "New Quote" button is clicked. The API returns a JSON object containing the quote with text and author, which is then displayed on the webpage using JavaScript.
The user can tweet the quote on twitter by clicking on the "tweet" button
The project also uses CSS to style the webpage and make it more visually appealing.

## üìñ Lessons Learned
By doing this Tech Quote Generator project on my own, I have learnt several valuable skills, including:

Working with APIs: The project involves fetching data from an external API and displaying it on a webpage. This helped me to learn how to make API requests, and work with APIs in general.

JavaScript Programming: The project heavily relies on JavaScript programming to fetch and display quotes. By doing this project, I learnt more about JavaScript functions, variables, and other essential programming concepts.

Web Development: The project also provided me an excellent opportunity to learn web development skills such as HTML and CSS. You can learn how to create webpages, style them with CSS, and add interactivity with JavaScript.
