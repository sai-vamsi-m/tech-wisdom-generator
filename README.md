# Tech Quote Generator

This project is a simple quote generator that displays a random quote each time the "New Quote" button is clicked. The quotes are fetched from a Quote Generator API and displayed on the webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By clicking on Tweet button, we can tweet the generated quote on twitter.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

This project was created using the following tools:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Quotable API


## ‚ùáÔ∏è Getting Started

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser, you should see a webpage with a "New Quote" and "Tweet" buttons. Clicking those buttons will display a new random quote on the page and can tweet the quote on twitter 

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
